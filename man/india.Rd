\title{
  Malnutrition of Children in India (DHS, 1998-99)
}

\description{
  Data sample from the Standard Demographic and Health Survey, 1998-99,
  on malnutrition of children in India. The data set contains
  approximately 12\% of the observations in the original data set and
  only a (very small) subset  of variables. Additionally, a boundary
  file representing the districts of India is provided for spatial analysis.
}

\usage{
data(india)
data(india.bnd)
}
\details{
  For details on the boundary file see function \code{\link[BayesX]{read.bnd}}
  from package \pkg{BayesX}.
}

\format{
  A data frame with 4000 observations on the following 6 variables:
  \describe{
    \item{\code{stunting}}{A numeric z-score for malnutrition, stunted
      growth to be more precise, which ranges from -6 to 6, where
      negative values represent malnourished children. Children with
      values below -2 are considered stunted (height-for-age).}
    \item{\code{cbmi}}{BMI of the child.}
    \item{\code{cage}}{Age of the child in months.}
    \item{\code{mbmi}}{BMI of the mother.}
    \item{\code{mage}}{Age of the mother in years.}
    \item{\code{mcdist}}{The district in India, where mother and child live.
      A factor encoded to match the map \code{\link{india.bnd}}.}
    \item{\code{mcdist_lab}}{The district in India, where mother and child live.
      A factor with actual district names.}
  }
