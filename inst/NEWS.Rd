\section{Changes in gamboostLSS version 2.0-0 (2017-05-05)}{
  \subsection{User-visible changes}{
    \itemize{
      \item Added new fitting algorithm which can be used via the argument 
        \code{method}:
        \itemize{
          \item \code{method = "cyclic"} is the standard approach which was also
             used previously.
          \item \code{method = "noncyclic"} provides a new non-cyclical algorithm. 
        }
        The \code{"noncyclic"} method allow faster cross-validation and better results
        for stability selection (see below). For details see 
           
        Thomas, J., Mayr, A., Bischl, B., Schmid, M., Smith, A., and Hofner, B. (2017), 
        Gradient boosting for distributional regression - faster tuning and improved 
        variable selection via noncyclical updates. 
        \emph{Statistics and Computing}. Online First. 
        DOI \href{http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11222-017-9754-6}{10.1007/s11222-017-9754-6}\cr
        (Preliminary version: \url{https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.10171}).
      \item Stability selection (\code{stabsel}) implemented for \code{gamboostLSS} 
         models.
      \item Models can now be fitted with zero steps (i.e., models containing only 
        the offset). This change was mainly realized with the release of mboost 2.8-0.
        This closes issue \href{https://github.com/boost-R/gamboostLSS/issues/22}{#22}.
      \item The \code{as.families} interface to incorporate \pkg{gamlss} distributions 
         for \code{gamboostLSS} models was adapted to allow for other link functions.
     \item Added option \code{stabilization = "L2"}  to use the average L2 norm of 
	     the negative gradient to make the updates for the different distribution 
	     parameters comparable. 
    }
  }
  \subsection{Bug-fixes}{
    \itemize{
      \item Fixed \code{as.families("BB")} and \code{as.families("BI")}, which is 
        actually an \pkg{mboost} family. Closes issue
        \href{https://github.com/boost-R/gamboostLSS/issues/12}{#12}.
      \item Fixed \code{as.families} for 4-parametric \code{"Mixed"}-type families
        (e.g. \code{as.families("BEOI")} and \code{as.families("BEINF")}).

  }
  \subsection{Miscellaneous}{
    \itemize{
      \item Added Janek Thomas as new author.
      \item Updated \file{inst/CITATION} due to release of JSS tutorial paper and

        The latter closes issue \href{https://github.com/boost-R/gamboostLSS/issues/27}{#27}.
      \item Updated URL in \file{DESCRIPTION}.
      \item Adapt \code{mboostLSS_fit()} such that it can be called by \code{FDboost::FDboostLSS()}.

\section{Changes in gamboostLSS version 1.2-1 (2016-03-11)}{
  \subsection{User-visible changes}{
    \itemize{
      \item Speed up computations by using \code{response(fitted())}
      instead of \code{fitted(, type = response)} as the latter uses
      \code{predict()}. Closes issue
      \href{https://github.com/boost-R/gamboostLSS/issues/5}{#5}.
      \item Improved output of \code{print.mboostLSS()} and
      \code{summary.mboostLSS()}. Closes issue
      \href{https://github.com/boost-R/gamboostLSS/issues/7}{#7}.
      \item Added \code{gamboostLSS_intern()} to make \pkg{FDboost}
      happy. Caution: Do not use this function.

  \subsection{Bug-fixes}{
    \itemize{
      \item Fixed tests for stabilization.

      model. Closes
      \href{https://github.com/boost-R/gamboostLSS/issues/9}{#9}.
    }
  }
}

\section{Changes in gamboostLSS version 1.2-0 (2015-08-19)}{
  \subsection{User-visible changes}{
    \itemize{
      \item New interface: Stabilization of negative gradient is now
      specified via families, e.g., \code{GaussianLSS(stabilization =
	"MAD")}. Using \code{options(gamboostLSS_stab_ngrad = TRUE)} is
      still supported for backward compatibility but discouraged.
      \item Added \code{weighted.median} which is used in \code{"MAD"}
      stabilization (see bugfixes).
      \item Added preliminary version of the tutorial paper as vignette,
      which is now available as \code{vignette("gamboostLSS_Tutorial",
	package = "gamboostLSS")}.
      \item Added \code{summary} function (request
      \href{https://github.com/boost-R/gamboostLSS/issues/2}{#2}).

      \href{https://github.com/boost-R/gamboostLSS/issues/3}{#3}).
      \item Use \code{weighted.median} to compute MAD when negative
      gradients are stabilized.
      \item Fixed handling of \pkg{gamlss.dist} families with \code{type
	= "Mixed"}.
      \item Fixed a bug in \code{as.families} with truncated \code{families}
      (which can be obtained using the package \pkg{gamlss.tr}).
      \item The internal helper \code{get_qfun} is now a generic
      function.
      \item  Adhere to CRAN policies regarding import of base packages
      (closes \href{https://github.com/boost-R/gamboostLSS/issues/1}{#1}).
